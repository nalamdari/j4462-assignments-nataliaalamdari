I decided to look at NPR Visual's Arrested Development project. I picked it for the obvious reason (Arrested Development is hilarious.) Before diving into the code, I looked up the actual project and poked around for a while. What super-fan came up with this? The app shows a timeline of the entire show, and where each running joke appears. So for example, every time the Bluths make chicken noises, it's highlighted on the timeline. To go even deeper, they separate it by character and season. 
There are a ton of pieces to this in the repository, and I can't really interpret any of them. What I really want to know, is how they were able to track when each joke appeared. Did someone watch every episode of Arrested Development? Did they analyze scripts? How long did it take to do all that? How many pieces do you have to fit together in order to get a project like this? And is updating hard, or a quick thing?
